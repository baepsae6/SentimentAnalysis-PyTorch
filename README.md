# SentimentAnalysis-PyTorch
Vanilla RNN model on pytorch.\n
The data is from http://study.mokoron.com/ \n
For pretrained embdeddings I used pre-trained fastText skipgram models from http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/intro/pretrained_vectors.html \n
The model showed accuracy of 98.44% on the dataset with brackts and around 70-80% on the dataset with no brackets \n
