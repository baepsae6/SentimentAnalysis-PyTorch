# SentimentAnalysis-PyTorch
Vanilla RNN model on pytorch.
The data is taken from http://study.mokoron.com/.
For pretrained embdeddings I used pre-trained fastText skipgram models from http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/intro/pretrained_vectors.html.
The model showed accuracy of 98.44% on the dataset with brackts and around 70-80% on the dataset with no brackets
